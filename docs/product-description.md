# Product Description

Booking Mate is a hybrid event booking SaaS for organizations that run classes, workshops, programs, sessions, or other scheduled offerings.

The main public-facing object is an event: something people can browse and register for. Internally, the platform treats the things needed to run those events as resources, such as instructors, locations, materials, equipment, or other custom assets. This keeps the product event-first today while leaving room for future appointment-style or resource-availability booking later.

Organizations use Booking Mate to create events, manage attendees, track registrations, assign resources, accept payments, share public booking pages, and monitor operational activity.

## Target Users

- Training academies.
- Studios and instructors.
- Workshop organizers.
- Community groups.
- Schools or small education programs.
- Businesses that run public or private events.
- Teams that need lightweight event/resource booking without a full enterprise system.

## Core Product Areas

### Events

Events are the primary booking unit.

Features:

- Create, edit, delete events.
- Publish, unpublish, or archive events.
- Track event status: upcoming, completed, cancelled.
- Set date, time, duration, location, category, capacity, and price.
- Support recurring events.
- Duplicate existing events.
- View events in table mode.
- View events in kanban mode.
- Filter and sort events by category, status, visibility, date, price, and registration count.

### Resources

Resources are the things used to run events.

Features:

- Manage instructors.
- Manage materials.
- Manage locations.
- Support custom resource types.
- Assign resources to events.
- Store resource-specific details like bio, email, phone, URL, address, capacity, notes, and metadata.

This is important because the product is not just events. It is a booking system where events are composed from reusable resources.
